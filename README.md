# Anthony-Bonanno-s-Profile
This is my profile featuring my works from my training to be a full-stack web developer.

## What was the motivation?

To help develop my skills at structuring a website, using only HTML and CSS. It also serves as my portfilio, so it may become a place where 
my works will be compiled for future employers to review, in the hope that I may be hired into a web development role.

## What problems does it solve?

It gives any future employer a quick and easy-to-understand overview of my motivations and capabilities, as evidenced through my work.
My works and projects are linked in the "Work" section of the webpage, and will take you to their respective pages upon clicking their images.
The nav bar also links to particular parts of the page to reduce the need for scrolling.

## What did you learn?

I learnt about the uses of classes and IDs when it comes to using CSS for customising a webpage's appearance.
Speaking of appearances, I also learnt how to use media queries to make the webpage look cleaner on smaller screen sizes, such as a phone screen.
With the use of flexboxes, I was able to make parts of the page change the way they appear when the screen size changes.
I feel I have also improved at using dev tools to test changes without committing them to my local files. Dev tools is a quick and easy way to 
guage what your code is doing to what parts of the page. Through the use of borders, I feel that the "Work" section of my webpage pops out more
compared to the rest of the page's content. This should help guide people in viewing what works I've done and plan do it in the future.
