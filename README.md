# Anthony-Bonanno-s-Profile
This is my profile featuring my works from my training to be a full-stack web developer.

## What was the motivation?

To help develop my skills at structuring a website, using only HTML and CSS. It also serves as my portfilio, so it may become a place where 
my works will be compiled for future employers to review.

## What problems does it solve?

It gives any future employer a quick and easy-to-understand overview of my motivations and capabilities, as evidenced through my work.
My works and projects are linked in the "Work" section of the webpage, and will take you to their respective pages upon clicking their images.

## What did you learn?

I learnt about the uses of classes and IDs when it comes to using CSS for customising a webpage's appearance.
Speaking of appearances, I also learnt how to use media queries to make the webpage look cleaner on smaller screen sizes, such as a phone screen.
With the use of flexboxes, I was able to make parts of the page change the way they appear when the screen size changes.
